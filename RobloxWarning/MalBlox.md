# MalBlox: Script Against Roblox Community Standards & Terms of Service

## What is MalBlox?

MalBlox refers to malicious or exploitative scripts and tools designed to manipulate or harm the Roblox platform, its games, or its users. These scripts often exploit vulnerabilities, inject unauthorized code, or provide unfair advantages.

## Why is MalBlox Harmful?

* Violates Roblox’s Terms of Service
* Harms the integrity and fairness of games
* Puts users’ accounts and data at risk
* Causes disruptions and negative user experiences
* Can lead to permanent bans or account termination

## Common Types of MalBlox Scripts

* Exploits that manipulate player stats (e.g., WalkSpeed, JumpPower cheats)
* Scripts that inject malicious code (e.g., `loadstring` usage)
* Unauthorized teleportation or item duplication
* Bots for spamming or harassment

## How Roblox Detects MalBlox

Roblox uses automated systems and community reports to detect exploitative behavior, including:

* Monitoring unusual gameplay patterns
* Scanning scripts for known exploit signatures
* Server-side validation of player actions

## Hyperion Detector

Roblox’s Hyperion system specifically detects exploit code such as usage of `loadstring`. When detected, the user is warned or banned with a reason labeled **ExploitDetected**. This helps prevent unauthorized code injection and maintains game security.

## Recommendations

* Avoid using or distributing MalBlox scripts
* Report suspicious scripts or behavior to Roblox
* Develop and promote safe, fair scripting practices
* Use official Roblox APIs and tools for development
